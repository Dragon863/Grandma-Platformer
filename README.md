# Grandma Platformer

This is a very silly project I worked on with Jacob and Isla at Scrapyard London. It is a godot game, and is screen captured by OBS and shared via virtual camera to OpenCV and sent over USB serial to a 64x64 LED matrix. See a demo at https://photos.scrapyard.london/share/ZXPpRru1IPdylpgwrHNi0ZoTmtMlXdHNuef4bc4D_b1CtjwwCSNrgG0IxslOLYOet7E !
